			<h1>Welcome</h1>
			<p>Welcome to my sample portfolio. While this won't be my definitive online presence in the long term, for now it provides some examples of what I can do.</p>
			<p>The specifications for this project are what determined the height of the section you're reading. Sorry that the amount of text doesn't fill it on most screens.</p>

			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>I'm reasonably active online. You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/acavender" id="profile-link" target="_blank">Github</a>, and on <a href="https://twitter.com/acavender" target="_blank">Twitter.</a>.</p>
			<p>I also blog semi-regularly at <a href="http://profhacker.com/"><em>ProfHacker</em></a>. We're in the process of moving, so if you try the link before October 1, 2018, you may not find anything other than a placeholder. Until we're up and running at our new home on the web, you can find our archives at the <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/"><em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em>'s website.</a></p>

						<h2>My academic site</h2>

					<h2>Saint Mary's Commons</h2>
					<p>At Saint Mary's College, the classes of 2018, 2019, and 2020 were part of an ePortfolio pilot project. They created their portfolio sites using a WordPress Multisite installation that I set up and continue to maintain. (Students from the class of 2021 onwards have been creating their portfolios in Blackboard.)</p>

						<h2>Women of Holy Cross 175th</h2>
						<p>This was a website for the 175th anniversary of the Women of Holy Cross (now the Marianites of Holy Cross, Sisters of Holy Cross, and Sisters of the Holy Cross). Originally it had its own domain, but when the registration lapsed I moved it to my WordPress Multisite installation.</p>
